# Welcome to MakeupSearch

This project was created as tech challenge solution. But it's more than challenge solution.

Here you can search for some makeup info. For example, you can search for CoverGirl lipsticks and filter them by price.

So I hope that the MakeSearch will be userful for you as it was for me. Thanks!
